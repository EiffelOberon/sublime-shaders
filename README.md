#About

ShaderLanguages is a [Sublime Text 2][1] syntax highlighting package for the [High Level][2] and [OpenGL Shader Language][3]s.

##Installation

This package has been submitted to the [Package Control][4] index and will hopefully soon be
available in the main list. You can then install it via the Command Palette (CTRL + Shift + P), typing
`install` and selecting `Package Control: Install Package`. In the subsequent popup textbox type
`shader` and pick the `ShaderLanguages` package.

In the meantime, or if you do not use Package Control, download a [zip][5] or [tarball][6] archive, extract the archive, rename the directory to `ShaderLanguages` and simply drop this directory into your Sublime Text 2 Packages directory.

You are then able to set the syntax from the Command Palette.

#NOTE

These syntax highlighting files are a work in progress and will still not highlight
all aspects of the shader language files. Please be patient.

#License

ShaderLanguages is released under the MIT license.
