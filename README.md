A Sublime Text syntax highlighting package for the High Level and OpenGL Shader Languages.

To install, simply drop the .tmLanguage files into your Sublime Text 2 Packages\User directory.
You are then able to set the syntax from the Command Palette.

This package has been submitted to the Package Control index and will hopefully soon be
available in the main list.

NOTE: these syntax highlighting files are a work in progress and will still not highlight
all aspects of the shader language files. Please be patient.
